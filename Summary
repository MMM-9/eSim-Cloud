Task 1: Incorporating new components in the Platform
I havenâ€™t completed the whole task but have reached up to creating the .json and .ts file for L293D and DHT11. 
These are the steps that I followed and I would love to know my mistake or the things that I were missing while performing the task.

Step 1: First various installations are done as per the guidelines given on https://github.com/frg-fossee/eSim-Cloud.
  
Step 2: I explored the features and try to simulate simple programs to get friendly with the IDE.

Step 3: I choose task 1 and read the docs, explored various json files component images and .ts files.
Step 4: I saved the image of DHT11 from internet and cropped and made a png file in paint.
  

Step 5: Converted the .png file to .svg format. Did the same steps for L293D
Step 6: Keeping in reference TMP36 & L298N made a json file for DHT11 and L293D motor driver.
Step 7: Created a .ts file for DHT11 taking reference from TMP36.
Step 8: Rebuilded the containers in docker after creating a branch repo and committing the changes.
Step 9: Refreshed the http://localhost/arduino/#/simulator to see the changes but the changes were not seen.
