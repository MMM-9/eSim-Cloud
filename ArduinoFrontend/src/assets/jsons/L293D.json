    "description": "The L293D is a popular 16-Pin Motor Driver IC. As the name suggests it is mainly used to drive motors. A single L293D IC is capable of running two DC motors at the same time; also the direction of these two motors can be controlled independently.",
    "properties": {
     "Can be used to run Two DC motors with the same IC"
	 "Speed and Direction control is possible"
	 "Motor voltage Vcc2 (Vs)": "4.5V to 36V"
	 "Maximum Peak motor current": "1.2A"
	 "Maximum Continuous Motor Current": "600mA"
	 "Supply Voltage to Vcc1(vss)": "4.5V to 7V"
	 "Transition time": "300ns (at 5Vand 24V)"
	 "Automatic Thermal shutdown is available"
	 "Available in 16-pin DIP, TSSOP, SOIC packages"
